# Happy Timer

Stay on track with a cheerful pomodoro-style timer built for Raycast.

[![raycast-cross-extension-badge]][raycast-cross-extension-link]

## What it does

- Start, pause, reset, and restart focus, short break, and long break intervals directly inside Raycast.
- Keep timers visible in the Raycast menu bar command for quick control.
- Tag sessions, add notes, and view a running log so you can review completed work.
- See daily and weekly stats that summarize how you spend your focus time.
- Celebrate completed intervals with quotes, sounds, and optional images or Giphy-powered GIFs.
- Tweak the active session’s name, tag, or duration right from the menu bar.
- (Optional) Sync your focus status to Slack using the dedicated Slack commands.
- Automatically toggle Apple Do Not Disturb when the companion Raycast extension is installed.

## Available commands

- `Control Happy Timer` – Manage the active interval or start a new tagged session.
- `Show Happy Timer in Menu Bar` – Keep timer controls pinned in the Raycast menu bar.
- `Start Tagged Timer` – Jump straight into a session with custom durations and tags.
- `Edit Current Session` – Update the running timer’s name, tag, or duration.
- `View Session Log` – Review past sessions grouped by tag.
- `View Happy Timer Stats` – Inspect daily or weekly focus metrics.
- `Slack Control Happy Timer` / `Slack Happy Timer in Menu Bar` – Mirror the core commands while updating your Slack status (disabled by default; enable via Raycast preferences).

## Run it locally

> Requires Raycast (macOS) with the [Ray CLI](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/getting-started/ray-cli) enabled and Node.js 18+.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the extension in Raycast
npm run dev    # runs `ray develop`

# (Optional) Build or lint from the terminal
npm run build
npm run lint
```

When `npm run dev` is running, open Raycast and search for "Happy Timer" to launch the commands above. Preference toggles (sounds, quotes, Do Not Disturb, Giphy, Slack, etc.) are configurable from the extension settings inside Raycast.

## Edit a running session

1. Click the Happy Timer icon in the macOS menu bar to open the current session controls.
2. Choose `Edit Session Details…` to launch the edit form with the timer’s existing name, tag, and length.
3. Adjust the fields you need and press `Save Changes`—the menu bar command refreshes immediately with your updates.

## Cross-extension integration

Happy Timer follows the [Raycast Cross-Extension Conventions][raycast-cross-extension-link]. The Do Not Disturb automation depends on the [yakitrak/do-not-disturb](https://www.raycast.com/yakitrak/do-not-disturb) extension—install and enable it if you want focus sessions to silence notifications automatically.

## Project docs & organization

- `README.md` (this file) – High-level overview, setup steps, and usage notes.
- `CHANGELOG.md` – Release history and noteworthy user-facing changes.
- `metadata/` – Store listing assets (screenshots) for the Raycast Gallery.
- `assets/` – Completion imagery used by default when timers finish.

## Known issues

- The Confetti preference interrupts the `Interval completed` dialog; leave it disabled for an uninterrupted flow.
